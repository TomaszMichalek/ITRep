Information Technology Repository

After graduated my BSc degree in Mechatronics I determined to try myself 
in IT - specialisation "Applicaion Frameworks for Java EE Platform" and make MSc degree. 
It's not easy but step by step and day over day I'm improving my abilities.

In this repository I will be pushing very different kinds of projects. From my most basic
codes to (for me) quite more complicated from Studies.

I have also started doing my master's thesis which will be a combination of Mechatronisc and Information Technology 
and also make use of 3D printing.
